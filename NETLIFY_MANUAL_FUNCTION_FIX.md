# Netlify Manual Function Fix - Studio RO

## Issue Resolved
The site was returning 404 errors despite successful builds when using the auto-generated Netlify adapter approach.

## Solution Applied
Switched from auto-generated function to manual function approach based on working repo analysis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Manual Server Function
**File: `netlify/functions/server.mjs`**
```javascript
import { createRequestHandler } from "@netlify/remix-adapter";
import * as build from "../../build/server/index.js";

export default createRequestHandler({
  build,
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV
});
```

### 2. Updated netlify.toml Configuration
**Changes made:**
- Functions directory: `.netlify/functions-internal` → `netlify/functions`
- Redirect target: `/.netlify/functions/remix-server` → `/.netlify/functions/server`
- Removed: `force = true` parameter
- Removed: `included_files = ["build/server/**"]`
- Removed: `[dev]` section

### 3. Updated package.json Dependencies
**Changes made:**
- Moved `@netlify/functions` and `@netlify/remix-adapter` from dependencies → devDependencies
- Updated versions:
  - `@netlify/functions`: ^2.6.0 → ^2.8.2
  - `@netlify/remix-adapter`: ^2.3.1 → ^2.6.1

## Why This Works

### Auto-Generated vs Manual Function
- **Previous approach**: Relied on Netlify adapter to auto-generate a `remix-server` function
- **New approach**: Manually create the server function with explicit control

### Benefits of Manual Approach
1. **Direct control** over the serverless function creation
2. **Explicit import path** to the build output
3. **Consistent naming** (`server` instead of `remix-server`)
4. **Simpler configuration** in netlify.toml

## Build Verification
✅ Build successful: `npm run build`
✅ Build outputs created:
- `build/client/` (static assets)
- `build/server/index.js` (server bundle)
- `netlify/functions/server.mjs` (manual function)

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are set in Netlify:
  - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
  - `SANITY_DATASET`

### After Deployment
- [ ] Verify Functions tab shows `server` function
- [ ] Test home page loads without 404
- [ ] Test API routes work
- [ ] Check function logs for any errors

## Key Learning
The Netlify adapter's auto-generated function approach can be unreliable. Using a manual function provides:
- Better debugging capabilities
- More predictable behavior
- Direct control over the serverless function

This approach mirrors the pattern used in successful deployments and provides a more stable foundation for the Studio RO website.
