# Netlify 404 Fix Summary

## Issue
Site returns 404 on home page despite successful deployment and presence of `remix-server` function.

## Root Cause
The redirect rule in `netlify.toml` was missing `force = true`, which has now been added.

## Current Status
✅ `netlify.toml` has correct configuration:
```toml
[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = "build/client"

[functions]
directory = ".netlify/functions-internal"
node_bundler = "esbuild"
included_files = ["build/server/**"]

[[redirects]]
from = "/*"
to = "/.netlify/functions/remix-server"
status = 200
force = true  # ← This was added to fix the issue
```

✅ Build outputs are correct:
- `.netlify/functions-internal/remix-server.mjs` exists
- `build/server/server.js` exists
- `build/client/` contains static assets

✅ Dependencies are correct:
- `@netlify/remix-adapter@2.6.0` is installed
- Vite config includes `netlifyPlugin()`

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the changes:
```bash
git add netlify.toml NETLIFY_FUNCTIONS_FIX.md NETLIFY_REDEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md NETLIFY_404_FIX_SUMMARY.md
git commit -m "Fix: Add force=true to Netlify redirect for proper Remix routing"
git push
```

2. The deployment should now work correctly with the updated configuration.

## Key Learning
For Remix + Netlify deployments using Vite and the Netlify adapter:
- Always include `force = true` in the catch-all redirect
- The `publish` directory should be `build/client` (not `public`)
- No `remix.config.js` or `server.js` files are needed in the root
- The adapter handles everything through the Vite plugin
